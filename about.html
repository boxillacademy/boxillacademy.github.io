                <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
                <p>Diane Boxill has been playing the piano since the age of 3. Her most influential teachers were Beryl Lake and Maria Ichnowski. She incorporates her knowledge of voice, guitar, drums, movement, and rhythm and integrates student interests in other instruments and artistic mediums into the piano lesson where appropriate. Students have the opportunity to participate in recitals and prepare for examinations with the Royal Conservatoryâ€™s Music Development Program if they choose. Diane has an MA in Education from Stanfordâ€™s Graduate School of Education.</p>
                <p>The learning environment Diane has created is sensitive to students of all ages, dispositions, and learning styles. Her focus is on the whole person. Over the years student ages have ranged from 3-70+ years. Lessons are customized to suit students for whom the study of piano comes relatively easily, as well as those with learning challenges and a wide variety of individual needs.</p>
